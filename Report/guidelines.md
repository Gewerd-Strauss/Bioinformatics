# Introduction to the report: rules

 * You will do the report in Rmarkdown.
 * You will be given a sequence (actually, you will be able to choose the
   sequence yourself). With this sequence you will have to complete a
   number of tasks:
   * Use BLAST (or another tool) to determine what is the protein that this
     sequence corresponds to (2pt).
   * Predict secondary structure of the sequence (4pt).
   * Find what protein domains are in the sequence (2pt).
   * Find the structure of a similar protein in PDB, compare the structure
     with the predictions of secondary structure (4pt)
   * Use BLAST to find a number of similar sequences (2pt)
   * Create an MSA (2pt)
   * Create a phylogenetic tree (2pt)

# Writing the report

 * With these tasks complete, you write a report
 * Report must be written in Rmarkdown
 * You must create a bibliography file and include the references
 * Like a scientific paper, the report must include the following parts:
    * Abstract: short description of your work
    * Introduction: explain what is the background of your work (e.g. why
      analysing proteins is important)
    * Methods: describe, *in detail*, the methods you will apply. Cite sources!
    * Results: describe, *with figures*, your findings. 
    * Discussion: what is your opinion? what else should / could one do?  What did you learn?
    * Bibliography

## Writing the report

There are three types of statements:

 * Statements by others: you must cite them.
 * Statements derived from your findings: you must back them up with results
 * Statements which are speculative: you must label them clearly as such

## Marking

The report will make out 30% of the total mark; you will get 0-30 points
depending on its completeness and (very rough) correctness.

 * 3 points for creativity (whatever I decide to view as such), because
   we need more creativity also in bioinformatics. This may be, but is not
   limited to
   * language
   * additional analyses
   * nice graphics
   * good questions
   * making me laugh
 * 18 points for (correctly) completing and documenting the tasks
 *  9 points for report structure, Rmarkdown, bibliography etc.

I am not expecting a scientific paper and I am not expecting you to waste
too much your time on that. So long as I know that you know what you're
doing and that you are able to create an Rmarkdown document, I am happy to
give you 27 points (for the extra 3, you need to get inventive).
