The test will be a multiple choice test. However, if you can answer the
following questions, you will not have any problems choosing the right
answers!

Note that it is more important to *understand* the concept than to learn a
definition by heart.


 1. Sequences and sequence searches
  * What is 5' and 3' end? What is N- and C- terminus?
  * What is an alignment? What is a '|', ':' and '.' in an alignment?
  * How do you score an alignment? 
  * What are gap penalties? What is the difference between a gap opening
    penalty and gap extension penalty?
  * What are global and local alignments?
  * What is the relationship between sequence homology and similarity?
  * What is a global alignment? What is a local alignment?
  * How does a progressive multiple sequence alignment work?
  * What do we use position specific scoring matrices for?

 2. Algorithms et al.
  * What is O(n)? What is O(n²)?
  * Which algorithm is better – O(n) or O(n²)? Or maybe $O(2^N)$?
  * What is the difference between heuristics and an exact algorithm?
  * How are BLOSUM matrices constructed?
  * What is a "sliding window" in sequence analysis?

 3. Statistics and co.
  * What is a log odds ratio? What does it mean log odds ratio is higher
    than 0, and what does it mean when it is negative?
  * What is a p-value? What is alpha, what is beta in the context of a p-value?
  * What is an effect size? What is the realtion between effect size, p-value and sample number?
  * What are type I (false positive, FP) and type II (false negative, FN) errors? 
  * What is "cherry picking" in the context of statistical analysis?
  * What is correction for multiple testing? 

 3. Evolution
  * What is sequence homology?
  * What are orthologs and paralogs?
  * What is neofunctionalisation and subfunctionalisation?
  * What is the relationship between amino acid similarity and substitution rate?

 4. Structure of genes and proteins
  * What is genetic code? How many different genetic codes are there?
  * What is an open reading frame? What is the first amino acid in a protein sequence?
  * What types of properties are important when considering amino acids?
    (note: I don't want you to learn by heart the properties of amino
    acids, except for the ones explicitely mentioned below)
  * Which amino acids are helix breakers?
  * What is primary, secondary, tertiary and quartenery protein structure?
  * What is a sequence logo?
  * What is a protein domain?
  * How many structural superfamilies are there? How many topologies? (roughly: 4, 40 thousand, 40 million?)
  * What are coiled coil? Do you know any examples of proteins or protein
    families with coiled coils?
