The test will be a multiple choice test. However, if you can answer the
following questions, you will not have any problems choosing the right
answers!

Note that it is more important to *understand* the concept than to learn a
definition by heart.


 1. Sequences and sequence searches
  * What is 5' and 3' end? What is N- and C- terminus?
  * What is an alignment? What is a '|', ':' and '.' in an alignment?
  * How do you score an alignment? 
  * What are gap penalties? What is the difference between a gap opening
    penalty and gap extension penalty?
  * What are global and local alignments?
  * What is the relationship between sequence homology and similarity?
  * What is a global alignment? What is a local alignment?
  * How does a progressive multiple sequence alignment work?
  * What do we use position specific scoring matrices for?

 2. Algorithms et al.
  * What is O(n)? What is O(n²)?
  * Which algorithm is better – O(n) or O(n²)? Or maybe $O(2^N)$?
  * What is the difference between heuristics and an exact algorithm?
  * How are BLOSUM matrices constructed?
  * What is a "sliding window" in sequence analysis?

 3. Statistics and co.
  * What is a log odds ratio? What does it mean log odds ratio is higher
    than 0, and what does it mean when it is negative?
  * What is a p-value? What is alpha, what is beta in the context of a p-value?
  * What is an effect size? What is the realtion between effect size, p-value and sample number?
  * What are type I (false positive, FP) and type II (false negative, FN) errors? 
  * What is "cherry picking" in the context of statistical analysis?
  * What is correction for multiple testing? 
  * What is a contingency table? Which tests can you apply to the table?

 3. Evolution
  * What is sequence homology?
  * What are orthologs and paralogs?
  * What is neofunctionalisation and subfunctionalisation?
  * What is the relationship between amino acid similarity and substitution rate?
  * What is natural selection? What are the three conditions for the
    natural selection to occur?
  * What are the three main mechanisms of evolution according to the modern
    synthesis?
  * Is genetic drift stronger for larger or for smaller populations?
  * What is positive and negative selection?
  * How can you detect evolutionary pressure in sequences?
  * What is a distance matrix? How can you use it in phylogenetic
    reconstructions?
  * Can you tell whether two trees have identical topology?
  * What is a rooted / unrooted tree?

 4. Structure of genes and proteins
  * What is genetic code? How many different genetic codes are there?
  * What is an open reading frame? What is the first amino acid in a protein sequence?
  * What types of properties are important when considering amino acids?
    (note: I don't want you to learn by heart the properties of amino
    acids, except for the ones explicitely mentioned below)
  * Which amino acids are helix breakers?
  * What is primary, secondary, tertiary and quartenery protein structure?
  * What is a sequence logo?
  * What is a protein domain?
  * How many structural superfamilies are there? How many topologies? (roughly: 4, 40 thousand, 40 million?)
  * What are coiled coils? Do you know any examples of proteins or protein
    families with coiled coils?

 5. Omics & co.

  * At which molecules are you looking when you are doing transcriptomics /
    proteomics / metabolomics / lipidomics?
  * In high throughput data sets, do you have typically more variables or
    more samples in a data set?
  * What are other typical characteristics of HT data sets?
  * What is the Phred quality score?
  * What probabilitstic distribution is suitable for count data?
  * What is gene set enrichment analysis? How do you make an ORA (1st
    generation gene set enrichment analysis) with a chi-square test?

 6. Clustering
  * How can you measure clustering performance?
  * Where do you take distances from when clustering using a distance-based
    method?
  * How does the elbow method work?

 7. Machine learning

  * What is the bias-variance tradeoff?
  * What is ROC? 
  * What is AUC? Is AUC=0.5 good or bad? And AUC=1?
  * What is sensitivity and specificity? If given a specific example
    (number of TN/TP,FN/FP) can you calculate sensitivity and specificity?
  * What is overfitting, underfitting?
