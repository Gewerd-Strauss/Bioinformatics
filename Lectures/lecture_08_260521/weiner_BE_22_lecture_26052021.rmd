## Ridiculome

.pull-left[
"As the -ome names imply, we expect such data to be complete collections of
components and/or properties. The problem is that they are neither complete
nor correct. It has been argued that they often do not help understanding,
and have occasionally been called the 'ridiculome'."

So, what exactly does the following figure tell us:

## Common characteristics of high throughput data sets

  * a lot more variables than samples, $p >> n$
  * many unknown / uncharacterized variables
  * atypical distributions
  * frequently:
      * batch effects
      * systematic bias
      * relative data (as opposed to absolute measurements in SI units)
      * large uncertainties for individual data points
      * huge files

## Genomics

 * Study of genomes (also: metagenomics $\sim$ comparative genomics)
 * Broader: any gene-related omics, including approaches combining several

## Transcriptomic parameters

(serves as an example of the complexity of each method)

 * Experimental design: number of samples needed? Which groups of samples?
   Which controls?
 * paired end or single end?
 * library size / read depth? (number of reads per sample: 5 millions, 10
   millions, 20 millions?)
 * library preparation:
    * globin depletion?
    * amplification?
    * UMI barcodes? (unique molecular identifiers)

## Example: Transcriptomic analysis
